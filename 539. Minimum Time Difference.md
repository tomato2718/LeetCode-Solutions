# 539. Minimum Time Difference

## Intuition

Translate 24 hour clock into timestamp of a day (0~1440), and find the minimun difference from all timestamps.

## Code

```py
HOURS_PER_DAY = 24
MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60


class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: list[str]) -> int:
        timestamps = [self._get_timestamp_from(time_point) for time_point in timePoints]
        min_differrence = self._find_min_difference(timestamps)
        return min_differrence

    def _get_timestamp_from(self, time_point: str) -> int:
        hour, minute = time_point.split(":")
        return int(hour) * MINUTES_PER_HOUR + int(minute)

    def _find_min_difference(self, timestamps: list[int]) -> int:
        timestamps.sort()
        min_difference_minute = (
            HOURS_PER_DAY * MINUTES_PER_HOUR + timestamps[0] - timestamps[-1]
        )
        for i in range(1, len(timestamps)):
            min_difference_minute = min(
                min_difference_minute, timestamps[i] - timestamps[i - 1]
            )
        return min_difference_minute


solution = Solution()
assert solution.findMinDifference(["23:59", "00:00"]) == 1
assert solution.findMinDifference(["00:00", "23:59", "00:00"]) == 0
```
